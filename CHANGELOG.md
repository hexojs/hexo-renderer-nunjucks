## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-26

This is a complete rewrite of [`morrisallison/hexo-renderer-nunjucks`](https://github.com/morrisallison/hexo-renderer-nunjucks).

The intent is to remove the hardcoded and unmaintained Swig renderer from [`hexojs/hexo`][hexo],
and to offer a solid and default renderer for [`hexo@5`][hexo].
